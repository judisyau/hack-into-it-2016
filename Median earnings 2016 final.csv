(X) Fewer than 100 sample cases (either men or women).  Base figure too small to meet statistical standards for reliability.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 -  An '-' entry in the median earnings columns indicates that no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
** An '**' entry in the margin of error column indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute a standard error and thus the margin of error. A statistical test is not appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"3 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the margin of error in relation to the size of the estimates, the less reliable the estimate. When added to and subtracted from the estimate, the margin of error forms the 90 percent confidence interval. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
