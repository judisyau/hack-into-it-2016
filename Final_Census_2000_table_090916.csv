"2 Estimates are based on survey data and are subject to sampling error. Prior to the implementation of the American Community Survey, presentation of the margin of error was not standard. For information on calculating standard errors for Census 2000 estimates and information on confidentiality protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, see http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf3.pdf.",,,,,,,,
"3 Estimates and median earnings may differ from a previously released Census Bureau report highlighting estimates and median earnings by sex in select occupations (Weinberg, Daniel H. 2004. ""Evidence From Census 2000 About Earnings by Detailed Occupation for Men and Women."" Census 2000 Special Reports CENSR-15.). The previously released report counts teachers working 37 or more weeks per year as full-time, year-round workers. Median earnings may differ due to improvements in methodology for calculating median earnings applied to this table. ",,,,,,,,
